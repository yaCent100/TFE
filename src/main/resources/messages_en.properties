# Response: Why rent your car?
response1_heading=1. Why rent your car?
response1_paragraph1=Renting your car not only allows you to generate extra income, but also maximizes the use of a vehicle that often remains unused. Here are a few main reasons:
response1_subheading1=A. Earn money with an unused vehicle
response1_paragraph2=Many car owners only use their cars a few days per month. During the times when your car is unused, it can generate income for you. Whether you are on vacation or only use your car for limited trips, DriveShare allows you to make it profitable. This can cover maintenance and insurance costs and even help you recoup the purchase price.
response1_subheading2=B. A service for others
response1_paragraph3=By renting out your vehicle, you help local residents or tourists who need a car at a reasonable price. This provides a more affordable alternative to traditional rental agencies, with savings of up to 30%.
response1_subheading3=C. Reduction of fixed costs
response1_paragraph4=Fixed costs associated with owning a car (insurance, maintenance, etc.) can be reduced by the income generated from the rental. This allows you to offset the expenses related to your vehicle while giving it better utility.

# Response: How much does renting your car earn?
response2_heading=2. How much does renting your car earn?
response2_paragraph1=The earnings from renting your car depend on several factors, including the vehicle model, local demand, and the length of the rental. Here are a few concrete examples:
response2_subheading1=A. Small used city cars
response2_paragraph2=A small used car, such as a Renault Twingo, can generate around â‚¬4,500 per year with a 70% usage rate. This more than covers annual maintenance costs and allows you to make the car profitable in less than two years.
response2_subheading2=B. New cars
response2_paragraph3=If you own a new car like a Dacia Duster or a Renault Clio, you can earn up to â‚¬8,000 per year. This type of vehicle is particularly popular with renters due to its comfort and reliability.
response2_subheading3=C. Managing multiple cars
response2_paragraph4=If you own multiple vehicles or are considering managing a fleet, your earnings can be even greater. Some owners generate over â‚¬20,000 per year by renting out several cars at different times of the year.

response4_paragraph1=Preparing your car for rental is essential to ensure a positive experience for your renters and maximize your chances of rental. Here are a few tips:
response4_subheading1=A. Ensure your car is in good condition
response4_paragraph2=Before each rental, make sure your car is in perfect working order. Ensure that the technical inspections are up to date, the tires are in good condition, and the fluid levels (oil, coolant, etc.) are correct. A well-maintained car attracts more renters.
response4_subheading2=B. Clean your vehicle
response4_paragraph3=A clean vehicle, both inside and out, is much more attractive to renters. Take the time to clean your car before each rental, especially the seats, dashboard, and trunk.
response4_subheading3=C. Necessary documents
response4_paragraph4=Ensure that all necessary documents are present in the vehicle, such as the registration certificate, insurance certificate, and technical inspection. This will make managing the rental easier and strengthen renters' confidence.

# Response: How to set the rental price?
response5_heading=5. How to set the rental price?
response5_paragraph1=Setting the price of your car rental is a crucial step to attract renters while maximizing your income.

response5_subheading1=A. Set three prices according to the season
response5_paragraph2=When registering your car on DriveShare, you will need to set three prices: one for the low season, one for the mid-season, and one for the high season. These periods can greatly influence demand, so it is essential to adjust your prices accordingly.
response5_subheading2=B. Check the recommended prices
response5_paragraph3=DriveShare provides you with a price recommendation chart based on your car's category and the season. This chart will help you set competitive prices while staying aligned with market trends. Use these recommendations as a guide to maximize your chances of regularly renting out your car.
response5_subheading3=C. Activate promotions based on rental duration
response5_paragraph4=To encourage long-term bookings, DriveShare allows you to offer automatic promotions based on the length of the rental. For example, you can offer progressive discounts to your renters:
response5_list1=10% discount for bookings longer than 14 days
response5_list2=20% discount for bookings longer than 30 days
response5_list3=You can also offer discounts of up to 50% for very long durations, depending on your preferences.
response5_subheading4=D. Be flexible with prices based on demand
response5_paragraph5=In addition to promotions, it is important to remain flexible with your prices based on seasonal demand. During periods of high demand (holidays, local events, etc.), you can slightly increase your prices to maximize income. Conversely, in slower periods, lowering prices slightly can attract more renters.
